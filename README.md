## Project Overview

This project is part of the Advanced Interaction Design (A-IXD) Project 2, focusing on enhancing the Bumble dating app experience. Rather than implementing proximity-based location features, this concept proposes a paradigm shift from "Digital Catalog" to "Digital Matchmaker" through an AI-powered matching system called **Beeline**.

### The Problem

- Users are overwhelmed with "swiping fatigue" without getting meaningful matches
- New features like Open Move lack visibility, leading to confusion
- Absence of integrated tools for venues or activities leads to indecisive conversations
- Users are matched based on a static snapshot from initial onboarding, rather than who they've evolved into today

### The Concept

**Beeline** is an evolving, conversational AI proxy that replaces "static profiles" with "dynamic chemistry." Instead of relying on a one-time onboarding quiz, Beeline lives in the app as a "nosy friend" that:

- Checks in after dates
- Asks about your day
- Learns your evolving preferences

Once it truly understands you, it enters a virtual "Hive" to interview the Wingmen (AI agents) of other users, conducting thousands of simulated conversations to return with only the most compatible, curated matches.

### How It Works

1. **Observation Phase**: The user goes about their normal Bumble experience. Occasionally, after a match or a long chat session, Beeline chimes in with quick, low-friction questions to understand preferences.

2. **Evolution**: Over 30 days, Beeline builds a "Rich Context Profile" that captures personality nuances, not just data points.

3. **Proxy Search**: When the user feels swipe fatigue, they trigger "Beeline Mode." The system conducts hundreds of "Proxy Chats" with other users' AI agents.

4. **The Outcome**: Beeline returns with curated matches—"I've talked to 500 Bees today. I think I found 'The One' for who you are today, not who you were when you signed up."

### Why Not Proximity-Based?

Research shows a significant negative correlation between Adoption Rate and Conversion Rate for proximity-based features. As more users try such features, the conversion rate actually drops. This concept leans into Bumble's brand value of **intentionality** over spontaneous location-based encounters.
